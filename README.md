# Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition  

## Overview  
This project focuses on training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize **Arabic handwritten characters**. The Arabic script presents unique challenges due to its **cursive nature, character shape variations, and high similarity between some letters**. This project aims to build a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying Arabic characters from images.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images of handwritten Arabic characters. Each image represents a single character, and the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Architecture  
A **CNN model** is implemented for feature extraction and classification. The architecture consists of:  
- **Convolutional layers** to detect spatial patterns in images  
- **Batch normalization** to stabilize training  
- **Max pooling layers** for downsampling  
- **Dropout layers** to reduce overfitting  
- **Fully connected layers** for final classification  

## Training and Evaluation  
The model is trained using **cross-entropy loss** and optimized with **Adam optimizer**. Performance is evaluated using:  
- **Accuracy** on validation and test sets  
- **Loss curves** to monitor training behavior  

## Results  
The trained model achieves a high accuracy in recognizing Arabic handwritten characters.

## Future Improvements  
- Experimenting with **transformer-based models** for sequence-based recognition  
- Enhancing preprocessing techniques for better input quality  
- Expanding the dataset with more diverse handwriting styles
